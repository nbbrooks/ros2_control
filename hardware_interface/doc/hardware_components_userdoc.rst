Hardware Components
-------------------
Hardware components represent abstraction of physical hardware in ros2_control framework.
There are three types of hardware Actuator, Sensor and System.
For details on each type check `Hardware Components description <https://ros-controls.github.io/control.ros.org/getting_started.html#hardware-components>`_.


Life cycle of Hardware Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Definitions and Nomenclature
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hardware interfaces use life cycle state machine `defined for ROS2 nodes <https://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html>`_.
There is only one addition to the state machine, that is the initialization method providing hardware configuration from URDF file as argument.

Hardware Interface
  User impl....

Hardware Components
  Wrapper and abstraction of hardware interface to mange life cycle and access to methods of hardware interface from Resource Manager.

Resource Manager
  Class responsible for management of hardware components in ros2_control framework.

"movement" command interfaces
  interfaces responsbible for robot to move, i.e., influence its dynamic behavior.
  The interfaces are defined in `hardware_interface_type_values.hpp <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/blob/master/hardware_interface/include/hardware_interface/types/hardware_interface_type_values.hpp>`_. (TODO: add link to doxygen)

"non-movement" command interfaces
  all other interfaces that are not "movement" command interfaces (TODO: add link to def.)


Initialization
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immediately after a plugin in loaded and object created with default constructor, ``on_init`` method will be called providing hardware URDF configuration using ``HardwareInfo`` structure.
In this stage you should initialize all memory you need and prepare storage for interfaces.
The resource manager will claim export of all interfaces after this and store them internally.


Configuration
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Precondition is hardware interface state having id: ``lifecycle_msgs::msg::State::PRIMARY_STATE_UNCONFIGURED``.
After configuration ``read`` and ``write`` methods will be called in the update loop.
This means all internal state and commands variables has to be initialized.
After successful call to ``on_configure``, Resource Manager makes all state interfaces and "non-movement" command interfaces available to controllers.

NOTE: If using "non-movement" command interfaces to parameterize robot in ``lifecycle_msgs::msg::State::PRIMARY_STATE_CONFIGURED`` state please take care about current state in the ``write`` method of your Hardware Interface implementation.





Migration from Foxy to Galactic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Between Foxy and Galactic we did substantial changes to interface of hardware components to enable management of their lifecycle.
The following list shows mandatory changes when porting existing hardware components to Galactic:

1. Rename ``configure`` to ``on_init`` and change return type to ``CallbackReturn``
1. If using BaseInterface then you should remove it and replace first three lines in ``on_init`` to:

.. code-block:: c++

   if (hardware_interface::[Actuator|Sensor|System]Interface::on_init(info) != CallbackReturn::SUCCESS)
   {
     return CallbackReturn::ERROR;
   }

1. Change last return of ``on_init`` to ``return CallbackReturn::SUCCESS;``;
1. Remove all lines with ``status_ = ...`` or ``status::...``
1. Rename ``start()`` to ``on_activate(const State & previous_state)`` and ``stop()`` to ``on_deactivate(const State & previous_state)``
1. Change return type of ``on_activate`` and ``on_deactivate`` to ``CallbackReturn``
1. Change last return of ``on_activate`` and ``on_deactivate`` to ``return CallbackReturn::SUCCESS;``
1. If you have any ``return_type::ERROR`` in ``on_init``, ``on_activate``, or ``in_deactivate`` change to ``CallbackReturn::ERROR``
